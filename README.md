## Trading System Overview (In development)
An automated options trading system and strategy that aims to maximize profit and minimize risk by incorporating the techniques:

### Diversification

Allocate capital across various options strategies to diversify risk, including both directional and non-directional strategies. This can be achieved by trading different types of options (e.g., calls, puts, European, American), different underlying assets (e.g., stocks, ETFs, indexes), and various expiration dates.

### Technical Analysis

Utilize technical analysis tools such as moving averages, support and resistance levels, and oscillators to identify trends, reversals, and momentum shifts in the market. This can help with timing entry and exit points for trades.

### Fundamental Analysis

Analyze the underlying assets by assessing financial statements, market news, and macroeconomic indicators. This can help identify options with attractive risk/reward profiles.

### Volatility Analysis

Monitor implied volatility (IV) and historical volatility (HV) to determine optimal entry and exit points for options trades. This can be done by using tools such as the Volatility Index (VIX) and the Implied Volatility Rank (IVR). Look for opportunities to sell options when IV is high and buy options when IV is low.

### Risk Management

Establish a predetermined risk/reward ratio for each trade and adjust position sizes accordingly. Implement stop losses and profit targets to minimize losses and lock in gains. Regularly review and adjust open positions to maintain the desired risk level.

### Time Decay Management

Be aware of the impact of time decay (theta) on options prices. Favor strategies that benefit from time decay, such as selling options or using spreads to offset theta risk.

### Trade Adjustment

Continuously monitor open positions and be prepared to adjust trades as market conditions change. This may involve rolling options to different strike prices or expiration dates, closing a position early, or adding new positions to hedge existing ones.

### Backtesting and Optimization

Test the strategy using historical data to evaluate its performance and optimize parameters. Continuously review and update the strategy as market conditions evolve.

### Discipline and Consistency

Follow the rules of the trading system and maintain consistency in execution. Avoid overtrading, and always adhere to risk management principles.

### Performance Tracking and Evaluation

Regularly track and analyze the performance of the trading strategy, identifying areas for improvement and adjusting as necessary.
